# Genix:  An automated pipeline for bacterial genome annotation

## About

Genix is an online automated pipeline for bacterial genome annotation. The program takes a FASTA file containing a set of sequences that can be complete chromosomes, contigs or scaffolds, and a tax_id identifier. First, a dataset of proteins associated to the tax_id "Is downloaded from Uniprot
and used to build a raw dataset, wich may contain several redundancies. CD-HIT (Li & Godzik 2006) is used to build a non-redundant dataset, wich is used to generate the final BLASTp (Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al. 2009) database. For the genome annotation, genix uses a combination of
several bioinformatics tools, including Prodigal (Hyatt et al. 2010), BLASTp, tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy 1997), RNAmmer (Lagesen et al. 2007), Aragorn (Laslett 2004), HMMER (Eddy 2011), BLASTn and INFERNAL (Nawrocki et al. 2009), RFam (Griffiths-Jones et al. 2003), Antifam (Eberhardt et al. 2012) and the non-redundant dataset generated by CD-HIT. At the end, genix generates a genbank file, containing all the features identified for each sequence, and, if requested by the user, a the genbank submission file (.sqn) generated by tbl2asn.
This package contains the source code of the genix’s annotation pipeline (genix_annotation.py),
some scripts for database preparation and for file formatation (located in the “scripts” directory),
and some of the binaries required to run Genix properly already compiled for Linux 64 bits
platforms.
Additionally, we have also added a demo version of the API we are currently developing to allow
batch submissions and commandline accession to some of the functionalities of the Genix server
(“WebAPI” directory). This folder contains a python script that uses the third-party “requests”
module to submit genomes, check the status and retrieve the results in Genbank format. Although
still very limited, we believe this tool will already be useful to perform batch submissions in just a
few Python lines of code.

#### Requeriments

**Operating System:** Linux (eg: Ubuntu) 64-bits

**Python Libraries:** BioPython (sequence operations) & Requests (for the WebAPI)

**Perl libraries:** Bio::SeqIO (sequence operations)

**Third-Party Programs:** RNAmmer (rRNA prediction)


## Installation

#### clonning the repository

```shellscript
$ git clone https://github.com/fredericokremer/genix/
$ cd genix
```

#### Editing the source code

Edit the variables `PERL_PATH` (path to the Perl executable), `PYTHON_PATH` (path to
the Python executable) and `RNAMMER_PATH` (path to the RNAmmer directory) are
correctly specified. Check if the binaries Prodigal (“bin/prodigal/”), Aragorn (“bin/Aragorn”), hmmer3 (“bin/hmmer3”), INFERNAL (“bin/infernal/src”), BLAST (“bin/ncbi-blast”) and tRNAscan-SE (“/bin/tRNAscan-SE”) are set as executable files. If not, you can use the command `chmod +x DIR/*` in each of the directories to provide executable permission. In some cases it may necessary to recombine some of these binaries, especially if you running then in a non-64 bits platform.

#### Installing the dependences

To install the Python and Perl modules in Ubuntu/Debian-based computers we have a shell script "install_dependences.sh" in the directory "dependences/", along with a "requeriments.txt" file for PIP. 

```shellscript
$ cd dependence/
$ sudo bash install_dependences.sh
```

## Using Genix

The user may also create an optimized protein database for a given taxonomic group of interest by using the `get_database.sh` by providing it's tax_id. First, a dataset of proteins associated to the tax_id Is downloaded from `Uniprot` and used to build a raw dataset, which may contain several redundances. `CD-HIT` (Li & Godzik 2006) is used to build a non-redundant dataset, which is paserd by an python script to identify the best annotation from each cluster based on the protein-score and the source from where the proteins were obtained (Uniprot-Swissprot or Uniprot-trEMBL). Finally, the refined dataset is used to generate the final protein `BLAST` database (Altschul et al. 1990; Camacho et al. 2009).

#### preparing the database



#### Running the annotation

```shellscript
$ python genix_annotation.py
```

#### Running the Example datasets



## WebAPI

Along with the source code we have added an python script that serves as example of how to submit
a genome to the Genix server using a commandline interface. The script “WebAPI.py”
located in the directory “WebAPI_example” uses the `requests` to send and retrieve data form the server by
using HTTP POST requests. We are still working on the development of the API, but it may already
be useful for some tasks.

### Submission

First, create a dictionary object with the following information (yes, in this version it is necessary to
add all values, but we are working on it, so as soon as possible it will change).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

submission_data = {
	'user_email' : 'fred.s.kremer@gmail.com',
	'user_password' : '1234',
	'genome_FASTA' : open('/home/cdtec/Frederico/genix/genix_annotation/'
	'versions/0.1/webAPI/leptospira.fasta').read(),
	'locus_tag_prefix':'GNX',
	'sequencing_center':'GNX',
	'genetic_code_table':'11',
	'database_construction':{
		'tax_id':'171',
		'clustering':'95'
		},
		'organism' : {
			'organism' : 'Leptospira interrogans',
			'serovar' : '',
			'serogroup' : '',
			'serotype' : '',
			'isolate' : '',
			'isolation_source':'',
			'strain':'',
			'host':''
			},
		'evalue_thresholds':{
			'protein_blast':0.0005, # float number, usually between 0 and 1
			'rfam_blast':0.0005,    # float number, usually between 0 and 1
			'antifam_hmmer':0.0005, # float number, usually between 0 and 1
			'rfam_infernal':0.0005  # float number, usually between 0 and 1
			}
	}
```

### Now, send it to the server as a JSON string.

```python
return_data = requests.post("http://labbioinfo.ufpel.edu.br/cgi-bin/genix_api.py",
                             data={'mode':'submission','data': json.dumps(submission_data)})
```

The return_data receives the value that is passed by the server after the request. In not error
occurred, the return_data will receive a JSON string, that can be converted to a dictionary
using the JSON module. The JSON object contains the JOB_ID of the submitted genome, so you
may use it to retrieve the result in a future moment.

## Webserver

Genix is also available as an webserver through the URL [http://labbioinfo.ufpel.edu.br/genix](http://labbioinfo.ufpel.edu.br/genix).
