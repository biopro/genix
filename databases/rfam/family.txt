In eukaryotes, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription, TFIIIA also stabilises 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 24.99 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	712	183439	0	0	Gene; rRNA;	Published; PMID:11283358	0	0		0.59496	-5.32219	1600000	213632	305	119	1	-3.78120	0.71822	2013-10-03 20:41:44	2014-04-11 10:33:03

There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	87	6190	0	0	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Published; PMID:19875933; Gardner PP	0	0		0.59795	-9.77278	1600000	400072	326	218	1	-3.83010	0.71077	2013-10-03 22:04:54	2014-03-31 12:05:50

It consists of 184 nucleotides that fold into an extended hairpin structure with a large single-stranded internal bulge. The 6S RNA specifically associates with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the sigma70 specificity factor. This interaction represses expression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase [1]. 6S RNA homologs have recently been identified in most bacterial genomes [2,3]. Many Gram-positive species have two copies of 6S RNA. In Bacillus subtilis, both copies appear to interact with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the housekeeping sigma factor and be expressed during different stages of growth. In many proteobacteria, 6S RNA may be processed from a transcript encoding homologs of the E. coli YgfA protein which is a putative methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 18.00 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	149	3611	0	0	Gene;	Published; PMID:15811922	0	0		0.56243	-10.04259	1600000	331091	277	188	1	-3.58950	0.71351	2013-10-03 22:05:06	2014-04-22 13:29:21

These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	5	428	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Published; PMID:9770508	0	0		0.53383	-8.38474	1600000	350673	177	85	1	-3.35620	0.71888	2013-02-01 11:56:19	2014-03-20 12:08:57

It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, as represented by this family. Eight helical elements fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region [1,2]. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP [1]. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54 M domain mediates signal sequence recognition [2,3]. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilises helix 8 for SRP54 binding [1]. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [4] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations. Many sequences below the threshold for this family are clearly closely related, but are most likely to be SRP RNA derived pseudogenes. The human genome in particular is known to contain a large amount of SRP RNA related sequence, including Alu repeats. While the threshold of this family is set high so as to minimise the number of hits to such regions, it is likely that some remain.

This family includes a significant number of annotated pseudogenes and the model is expected to discriminate poorly between real and Y RNA related pseudogenes.

Its role is to liberate the mRNA from a stalled ribosome. To accomplish this part of the tmRNA is used as a reading frame that ends in a translation stop signal. The broken mRNA is replaced in the ribosome by the tmRNA and translation of the tmRNA leads to addition of a proteolysis tag to the incomplete protein enabling recognition by a protease. Recently a number of permuted tmRNA genes have been found encoded in two parts. tmRNAs have been identified in eubacteria and some chloroplasts but are absent from archaeal and eukaryote nuclear genomes.	10Sa_RNA; SsrA	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 16.62 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	477	6350	0	0	Gene;	Published; PMID:19617710	0	0		0.70410	-10.32425	1600000	541479	1336	354	1	-4.19500	0.70396	2013-10-03 23:09:12	2014-05-29 13:27:49

Both miRNAs let-7 and mir-98 have now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of species (MIPF:MIPF000002). miRNAs are transcribed as ~70nt precursors (modelled here) and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22nt product. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA.

A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 23.00 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	92	38090	0	0	Intron;	Predicted; PFOLD	0	0		0.56520	-7.49312	1600000	262242	581	93	1	-3.57660	0.71847	2013-10-03 23:17:00	2014-04-04 12:10:27

The packaging of DNA into the procapsid requires a molecular motor which using ATP as energy to accomplish the energetically unfavourable motion. In some bacteriophage, an RNA (pRNA) molecule is a vital component of this motor [1]. Structural analyses of the packaging motor have demonstrated that the pRNA molecule has fivefold symmetry when attached to the prohead [2-4]. The pRNA is thought to be bound by the capsid connector protein (PFAM:PF05352) [4]. Only the first 120 bases of the pRNA are essential for packing the viral DNA [5,6]. The pRNA is proposed to be comprised of two domains, one corresponding to the first 120 bases and the second to the remaining 50 bases [6]. Nuclear cleavage occurs in the single strand region linking these two domains [6].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	3	8	0	0	Gene;	Predicted; ILM	0	0		0.67619	-8.85020	1600000	385188	387	244	1	-3.78590	0.70874	2013-10-03 23:21:21	2014-03-20 16:16:35

CsrC RNA binds multiple copies of CsrA Pfam:PF02599, a protein that post-transcriptionally regulates central carbon flux, biofilm formation and motility in E. coli. CsrC antagonises the regulatory effects of CsrA, presumably by sequestering this protein. The discovery of CsrC is intriguing, in that a similar sRNA, CsrB, performs essentially the same function. Both sRNAs possess similar imperfect repeat sequences (18 in CsrB, nine in CsrC), primarily localised in the loops of predicted hairpins, which may serve as CsrA binding elements. Transcription of csrC increases as the culture approaches the stationary phase of growth and is indirectly activated by CsrA via the response regulator UvrY [1].

Two independent studies have found that 7SK RNA binds the CDK9/cyclin T complex (known as elongation factor P-TEFb). P-TEFb activates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. This process is negatively regulated by the 7SK RNP. The secondary structure of 7SK RNA shown here was proposed by Wasserman and Steitz on the basis of chemical modification and enzymatic cleavage experiments [2].

The conserved uridine-turn links helix I to helix II and usually has the sequence CUGA. Helix II and III are linked by a sequence CGAAA. The cleavage reaction occurs between helix III and I, and is usually a C. Hammerhead ribozymes are found in plant viroids and other small replicating satellite RNA species.

The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA (RFAM:RF00017) and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect.

Translational silencing of Cp, and possibly other transcripts, mediated by the GAIT element may contribute to the resolution of the local inflammatory response following cytokine activation of macrophages [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	8	72	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:12588972	0	0		0.62086	-3.07584	1600000	277816	160	71	1	-3.43170	0.71895	2013-10-04 00:09:50	2014-03-20 15:45:15

REN-SRE is thought to destabilise the mRNA, promoting degradation of the sequence. It has been found that a number of proteins bind to the REN-SRE to stabilise the mRNA and promote translation. Renin is secreted by renal juxtaglomerular cells and catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I which is the rate-limiting step in the production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II induces hypertension and REN therefore requires tight control to ensure expression appropriate to need [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	13	86	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:12933794	0	0		0.67193	-7.73983	1600000	794799	102	37	1	-3.75150	0.72007	2013-10-04 00:10:02	2014-03-21 18:51:08

These two clusters are named SNORD113 and SNORD114 respectively in the HGNC approved gene symbol nomenclature. The snoRNAs found in both clusters are clearly related and are represented here by a single family. These snoRNAs are intron encoded and are processed from the tissue-specific non-coding human MEG8 RNA, which lies downstream of the imprinted genes DLK1 and GTL2. snoRNAs 14q(I) and 14q(II) differ from previously identified C/D box snoRNAs in their expression profiles and lack of complementarity to rRNA and snRNA. Homologues of these snoRNAs are found in the imprinted non-coding mouse transcript Rian, and in the rat non-coding Bsr (brain-specific repetitive) RNA.	sno_14q_I_II; sno_14q_I	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 24 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	59	2264	0	0	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Published; PMID:12045206	0	0		0.60854	-4.00500	1600000	251093	228	75	1	-3.56590	0.71868	2013-10-04 00:10:06	2014-03-21 16:44:37

G-CSF is secreted by fibroblasts and endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha and by activated macrophages. The synthesis of G-CSF is regulated both transcriptionally and through control of mRNA stability. In unstimulated cells G-CSF mRNA is unstable but becomes stabilised in response to IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha, and also in the case of monocytes and macrophages, in response to lipopolysaccharide. It is likely that the presence of the SLDE in the G-CSF mRNA contributes to the specificity of regulation of G-CSF mRNA and enhances the rate of shortening of the poly(A) tail [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	16	76	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:11865046	0	0		0.54365	-7.72831	1600000	282580	189	96	1	-3.21690	0.71864	2013-10-04 00:10:24	2014-03-20 10:37:23

When first expressed in early embryogenesis, fushi tarazu mRNA is uniformly distributed over most of the embryo. Subsequently, fushi tarazu mRNA expression rapidly evolves into a pattern of seven stripes that encircle the embryo. The instability of fushi tarazu mRNA is probably crucial for attaining this localised pattern of expression [1]. Experiments provide evidence for at least two destabilising elements in the fushi tarazu mRNA, one located within the 5' one-third of the mRNA and the other near the 3' end (termed FIE3 for ftz instability element 3'). The FIE3 lies within a 201-nucleotide sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation signal and can act autonomously to destabilise a heterologous mRNA. Further deletion constructs identified an essential 68-nucleotide element within the FIE3 [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	5	31	0	0	Cis-reg;	Predicted; stemloc, Bateman A	0	0		0.46445	-7.35881	1600000	385132	253	65	1	-3.45660	0.71953	2013-10-04 00:20:33	2014-03-18 13:49:44

This C/D box domain U91 (also known as U4-8) was identified by Darzacq and is predicted to guide the 2'O-ribose methylation of U4 snRNA C8 [1]. This C/D domain was later found associated in tandem with another C/D box domain U12-22 (RFAM:RF00492). Both the doublet (U12-22/U4-8) and singlet (U4-8) forms of this snRNA have been purified from Hela cells [1]. The doublet form U12-22/U4-8 has been shown to localise to the nucleoplasm and is proposed to reside in the Cajal bodies whereas the U4-8 single domain appears to accumulate in the nucleolus [3]. In humans the genomic location of U12-88/U4-8 is intergenic and the purified transcript has been shown to possess a methylated guanosine cap suggesting it is independently transcribed by RNA pol II [3].

Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	70	371	0	0	Gene; ribozyme;	Published; PMID:9847214	0	0		0.69973	-9.74148	1600000	423094	968	303	1	-4.35440	0.70576	2013-10-04 00:36:13	2014-03-31 09:37:04

Antizyme genes have have two partially overlapping open reading frames, the second, which encodes the functional protein requires +1 translational frameshifting. This frameshift is stimulated by a pseudoknot present 3' of the frameshift site in the antizyme mRNA. The frameshifting efficiency is dependent on the level of polyamines in the cell, when the polyamine concentration is high frameshifting is more likely to occur which leads to an increase in the quantity of functional antizyme produced. The functional antizyme acts to reduce ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity which leads to a drop in polyamines present in the cell. Therefore, this family can be thought of as a biosensor for intracellular free polyamines [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 21 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	13	328	0	0	Cis-reg; frameshift_element;	Published; PMID:15147837	0	0		0.66203	-4.23694	1600000	362460	137	59	1	-3.38040	0.71923	2013-10-04 00:37:38	2014-03-21 16:02:59

The 5' and 3' C/D domains are predicted to guide the 2'O-ribose methylation of residue U22 in U12 (RFAM:RF00007) and residue C8 in U4 (RFAM:RF00015) snRNAs respectively [1]. This family only includes only the 5' C/D box domain (U12-22) as the 3' C/D box is represented by RFAM:RF00283. The 3' C/D domain (U4-8) was also cloned previously by Darzacq [2] and called U91. Both the doublet (U12-22/U4-8) and singlet (U4-8) forms of this snRNA have been purified from Hela cells [1].

The cHP cis element has been shown to direct translation start from the thermodynamically unstable first start codon [1]. The ability of cHP to direct initiation from the first start codon is proportional to its thermodynamic stability, is position dependent, and is sequence independent [1].

U6atac is the functional analog of U6 (Rfam:RF00026) in the major U2-type spliceosomal complex [2].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	62	2860	0	0	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Published; PMID:11911359	0	0		0.65236	-8.23780	1600000	287519	218	126	1	-3.47370	0.71803	2013-10-04 01:04:54	2014-06-12 14:00:21
RF00620	HCV_ARF_SL	1852	Hepatitis C alternative reading frame stem-loop	Daub J	INFERNAL	80.00	80.00	79.90	The core protein-coding region of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome contains a +1 alternative reading frame (ARF) and two proposed phylogenetically conserved RNA helix-forming stem loop structures [1]. The proteins translated from the ARF appear to be translated during the normal viral life cycle but are not essential to virus replication [1]. The two predicted stem loops included in this model (SLV and SLVI) are proposed to be important for HCV translation and repression [1]. These stem loops are located downstream of the IRES site but their functional role is unknown [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	36	7986	0	0	Cis-reg;	Predicted; RNAalifold	0	0		0.63237	-6.80243	1600000	325831	272	153	1	-3.09700	0.71808	2013-10-04 01:05:07	2014-03-28 13:40:24
RF00621	CoTC_ribozyme	1853	Beta-globin co-transcriptional cleavage ribozyme	Daub J	Daub J	58.00	59.90	57.90	Transcription termination of RNA polymerase II transcripts is proposed to occur by a two stage process [1]. The first stage involves pre-termination cleavage (PTC) of the nascent transcript downstream of the poly(A) site. This process is also referred to as co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). The CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene has been shown to involve an RNA self-cleaving activity located in the 3' flanking region of the beta-globin gene. This Rfam model represents the catalytic core of the beta-globin CoTC ribozyme. The CoTC core is highly conserved in the 3' flanking regions of other primate beta-globin genes [2]. Functionally, this CoTC ribozyme resembles the 3' processive, self-cleaving ribozymes described for the protein-encoding genes from the myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum polycephalum [2].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	10	47	0	0	Gene; ribozyme;	Published; PMID:15565159	0	0		0.53359	-9.27125	1600000	347041	319	191	1	-3.22190	0.71321	2013-10-04 01:05:20	2014-03-20 12:10:24

RF00684	mir-122	1896	mir-122 microRNA precursor	Nawrocki EP	Nawrocki EP	70.00	76.90	50.50	miR-122 is miRNA precursor family MIPF:MIPF0000095 that appears to be vertebrate specific. In mammals, miR-122 is enriched in liver cells where it has been implicated as a regulator of fatty-acid metabolism in mouse studies. The hairpin precursors (represented here) are predicted based on base pairing and cross-species conservation -- their extents are not known. In this case the mature sequence is excised from the 5' arm of the hairpin.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	26	89	0	0	Gene; miRNA;	Predicted; RNAalifold	0	0		0.67843	-2.88712	1600000	177842	162	74	1	-3.71160	0.71904	2013-10-04 01:10:15	2014-03-20 14:27:02

The ROSE element is a negative regulator of heat shock gene expression. The secondary structure is thought to be regulated by temperature. This regulation blocks access to the ribosome binding site under normal conditions. During heat shock however, the structure changes freeing the ribosome binding site and allowing expression to occur [1,2]. This family includes predicted members of the family from gamma-proteobacteria.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	14	440	0	0	Cis-reg; thermoregulator;	Published; PMID:16438677; Bateman A	0	0		0.63393	-4.51852	1600000	223637	158	73	1	-3.75380	0.71895	2013-10-04 02:51:18	2014-03-20 14:08:07

There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 20.23 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	66	371	0	0	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Published; PMID:19875933	0	0		0.64339	-9.13412	1600000	467174	724	276	1	-4.34560	0.70709	2013-10-04 02:51:41	2014-03-31 13:04:57

RF01848	ACEA_U3	1312	ACEA small nucleolar RNA U3	Gardner PP	Published; PMID:19875933	55.00	55.00	54.90	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites.

The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA (RFAM:RF00017) and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [1] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations.

It is located within the p15/CDKN2B-p16/CDKN2A-p14/ARF gene cluster, in the antisense direction. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which alter the expression of CDKN2B-AS are associated with many diseases, including coronary artery disease, diabetes and many cancers [1]. It binds to chromobox 7 (CBX7) within the polycomb repressive complex 1 and to SUZ12, a component of polycomb repression complex 2 and through these interactions is involved in transciptional repression [2,3].

They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI. This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	237	1822	0	0	Intron;	Predicted; Weinberg Z	0	0		0.52566	-9.55999	1600000	435829	229	84	1	-4.23640	0.71860	2013-10-04 03:18:00	2014-03-20 17:10:19
